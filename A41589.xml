            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57039:3"/>
never be ſuppoſed to have been
more ſignall in any point than in
Politicall Obſervations. He as a
King well underſtood the Duty
of his Place, the Power that was
repoſed in him, and the Obedience
that was required of them whom
God had placed under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
He knew the things that
contributed to the happineſs of a
Kingdom, and what were the moſt
likely means either to eſtabliſh, or
ſhake his Throne, and therefore in
the Words before us forewarns his
Subjects againſt Popular Tumults
and Inſurrections, ſhews them the
danger that there was, though they
were many, and He but One, of
entring into Leagues and Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

upon it, we may reap this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
That though the World
preſents us only with a proſpect
of our danger from the Heat and
Fury of an Audacious People, the
Church (that always was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
of the Godly) ſuggeſts unto
us more comfortable meditations of
Safety and Deliverance. Here we
have ancient and undoubted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents

<hi>1 Sam. 15. 23. Rebellion is as
the ſin of witchcraft, and Stubborneſs
is as iniquity and idolatry. Witchcraft</hi>
is nothing leſs then a renouncing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57039:5"/>
God, and entring into a Solemn
League and Covenant with his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
enemy the devil: <hi>Idolatry</hi> is the
forſaking Him to whom we owe
the higheſt Worſhip and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and paying a Devotion to
them that are not Gods; whom we
unjuſtly ſet up over us, attributing
an Imaginary power to them, who
are not able either to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or give any ſuccour or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
and then how nearly is
Rebellion joyned, how fitly to be
compared with either of theſe, is
eaſie to be obſerved in all its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
For Rebels either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Allegiance to their
natural Prince, who is and ſhould
be in Gods ſtead over them; and
joyn themſelves to ſome that is his
Enemy, as in the caſe of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,

their own, and pay their worſhip
to the Works of their own hands,
making them Rulers whom they
know to be no Such, and ſtand in
fear, and reverence of a power of
their own Creating; which is but
too conformable to the notion of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry:

nay the houſe-tops were not high

the whole Creation is made to

I ſhall only deſire you to conſider
whence they that practiſe it took
their firſt pattern; 'Twas Satan
was the ringleader of the Rebels,
who ventured to level his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

and diſturb the Happineſs of Gods
Vicegerents upon earth: ſo that
we may ſay of them in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
words, <hi>Joh. 8. 44. They are

Men are moſt likely to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with a conſiderable portion in
it; beſide ſome other puniſhment
which you may be aſſured will
overtake them, as I propounded

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Who it is that Wicked
men engage againſt in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and that is not only Man
but God: for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57039:8"/>
               <hi>Rom. 13. 1, 2. There is no Power but

of;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31.</note> ſo <hi>fearfull a thing
it is to fall into the hands of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God:</hi> yet that they may not
wholly ſeem to be put off to a
Future puniſhment, which Men
of their principles may poſſibly give
no belief to,</p>
            <p>We may conceive in the ſecond
place the Wrath of a King (which
without <hi>Solomons</hi> telling them they
well enough know to be Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57039:8"/>

by certain though perhaps ſlow
degrees will go on to overtake
them.</p>
            <p>For can we think that God who
hath made ſo good proviſion for the
Lives of heathen Princes, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all men to pay Obedience,
even to the Enemies and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Church of his Son
(for ſuch the Powers were, the
Emperours that then ruled when
St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles) and

of his people, thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble

their Love and Tenderneſs to his

they have received from him?
Can we, I ſay, imagine that ſuch
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57039:9"/>
ſhould be left deſtitute of his
Immediate protection? who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they ought to be, <hi>not a
Terrour to Good Works</hi> muſt needs
be ſuch to the Evil;<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4</note> and as they
are ordained <hi>Gods Miniſters for
good to us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—5.</note> ſo are they in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by him appointed <hi>Revengrs to
execute wrath upon him that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi>
who having the Juſtice of
the Cauſe on their ſide, fight to
maintain Gods right as well as their
own, have a good Conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating
them within, have the
Hearts and Hands of all that are
Loyall, the Prayers of all that are
Devout to aſſiſt them. Such For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are not eaſily overthrown, by
Men whoſe conſciences fly in their
faces; whoſe guilt conveys more
fear into their Hearts, than their
Deſpair of pardon (whence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57039:9"/>
commonly their Rage proceeds)
can ſupply them with of valour
and reſolution.</p>
            <p>But it is true that Temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
hath not always been
allotted to Rebels and Traytors;
ſometimes their Arms have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered
in deſpite of Juſtice, and
their Impiety hath been reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Victory and Succeſs; yet
we have known ſuch Men before
this time who have found a Turn
of their good Fortune, and by
their Infamous and Deſerved
Deaths have left a Teſtimony to
the World, that Rebellion though
it may be ſucceſsfull, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
long-liv'd; and if ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Courſes may at ſome time
raiſe a man High, yet they never
put him out of danger or fear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57039:10"/>
of Falling: and ſuch a Mans pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
cannot always be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
which Juſtice longs to inflict
on him, either by the open force
and power of his Prince; or the
Secret Treachery of his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For who can repoſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Confidence in them whom
their Allegiance could not contain
within the bounds of Loyalty?
And there are Examples to be
found, of Men that have bought
their peace with the Lives of their
Confederates, and by giving up
their Fellows Heads, made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
for their Own. Which
we may be the rather induced to
beleeve, if</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We conſider what bad
entertainment Rebellious practices
have hitherto found in the world;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57039:10"/>
in that he that has once dared to
violate the Majeſty of Kings, hath
ſeldome found all the <hi>Hands</hi> that
he could <hi>joyn</hi> together ſufficient
to uphold an Uſurped Throne;
and hath taught others to bear no
more reſpect to himſelf than he
hath ſhewed, and given them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
a pretence to diſpoſſeſs him
for Unjuſtly Invading anothers
Right: which being once taken
away, and Power become the
Rule of Juſtice; there have often
riſen up a Sort of Men preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it, who never failed to
give one another their Deſerved
puniſhment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not mention any thing
in Humane Writers to illuſtrate
this, but confine my ſelf wholly
to Divine Authority; eſpecially
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57039:11"/>
becauſe the Spirit of Rebellion
that any time within theſe late
Years hath been Diſturbing the
peace and happineſs of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
hath always made pretences
to Religion, wherewith it ſought
to colour and maintain its Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abimelech</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gideon</hi> was
an early Uſurper of the Liberties of
his people,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.</note> and ſtrengthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by the Confederacy of the
<hi>Shechemites,</hi> and the murder of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
of his Brethren; yet after
three years time, himſelf became a
means to puniſh thoſe his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in wickedneſs, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of all their City, for their
Rebellion againſt him; and He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his puniſhment by the hand
of a Woman, God making uſe of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57039:11"/>
the weakneſs of that Sex to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
him that had many Hands and
a great Army joyned with him.</p>
            <p>'Twas the conſideration of ſome
ſuch Divine vengeance to enſue,
that reſtrained <hi>Davids</hi> hand from
ſlaying <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.</note> whom though his
bitter Enemy, and at that very time
ſeeking his Life, in that he was
the Lords Anointed he would not
kill, though he had a notable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
though he was inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Servants with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the promiſe of the
Lord,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.</note> 
               <hi>to deliver his Enemy into his
hand, that he might do to him as it
ſhould ſeem good unto him.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
could Opportunity have tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to a Rebellious thought, or
his Confidence in the Strength
and Valour of his Aſſiſtants have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57039:12"/>
wrought him to an Action which
he acknowledged no man could
do and be Guiltleſs, he might as
eaſily have cut off his Head, as the
Skirt of his Robe, and taken away
his Life, as the Spear which was
ſet to defend it. But 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if a righteous Man would not
venture on ſuch a piece of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
(though with ſome reaſon
he might have promiſed himſelf
Freedom from being puniſhed for
it by any Humane means, being
ſo well accompanied with ſuch
Valiant Men ſo ready to defend
the Fact) when even a Woman
(and ſhe too one of the wickedeſt
upon record) had ſo much Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Religion in her, as to think
no Condition, how great ſoever,
ſafe and exempt from Vengeance
if it were purchaſed by Rebellion:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57039:12"/>
'twas <hi>Jezebel</hi> I mean, who ſeeing
<hi>Johu</hi> entring the Palace after he had
ſlain her Son,<note place="margin">2 Kings 9. 31.</note> his King, <hi>Jehoram,</hi>
chargeth him with Rebellion, and
by a late example denounceth the
like Vengeance to him, that <hi>Zimri
had who ſlew his maſter.</hi> So much
a Woman that ſlighted juſtice in
other matters, thought it not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be avoided when ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Crime called out to Heaven
for it.</p>
            <p>And thus indeed it uſually has
fared with them that think to force
their paſſage to a Crown, moſt
commonly they have periſhed in
the Attempt; or if they have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
themſelves of their Deſires,
yet then, not all the Strength that
they could make, and Guards they
ſet upon their Perſons, could ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57039:13"/>
them Secure from puniſhment,
but uſually God hath raiſed up
ſome to pay them what they have
deſerved, and render them the fruit
of their own Inventions.</p>
            <p>And if after ſo fair warning any
that take Rebellious Courſes ſhould
think to ſucceed better at laſt, it
appears to me a ſign not only of
wicked and depraved Manners,
but of ſtupid and ſottiſh Minds;
Can they imagine their Hands were
ſtronger than theirs that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them? yet ſurely they cannot
think to eſcape Gods juſtice, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
themſelves out of his hand.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we think, but that as
ſuch Men do approve themſelves
to be very Evil perſons, ſo have
they in a ſpecial manner appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57039:13"/>
to themſelves one Character
of the Wicked uſed in Scripture,
being Men <hi>that forget God,</hi> or have
not known him? and that they
have as little reaſon to pretend to
Religion as to Loyalty, and that
their Abſurdity is as great when
they declare they ſtand up for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in oppoſition to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, and the Directions
of the Apoſtles, as theirs that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
pretended to maintain the
Authority of the King, to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of his Kingdoms, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of his Perſon.</p>
            <p>I hope it will be needleſs at this
time of day to perſuade men not to
cheat themſelves with ſuch nice Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions,
which one word of
ſound and reall Wiſdom will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſolve, and this the Wiſe man
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57039:14"/>
teacheth, that you ſhould <hi>fear the
Lord, and the King</hi> for his ſake,
that you ſhould make your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
the foundation of your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
<note place="margin">Prov. 24. 21, 22.</note> and <hi>not meddle with them
that are given to change, For their
calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who
knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God be praiſed we do;
and by his mercy are able to retort
upon our Republican Party their
own Argument drawn from Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
which when it goes along
with the Right Side, is then indeed
only proper to be urged as a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Gods Favour and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
For we have ſeen the
Counſels of Crafty men defeated,
and the continued Deſigns that have
been hatching ſeveral Years,
brought to naught in a ſhort while,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57039:14"/>
the Numbers that were joyned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
and broken, and thoſe
that were Expected, rendred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
to do Themſelves or the
Kingdom more Miſchief: and
though their Strength was formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and their Confederates many,
yet when we think how they are
brought to puniſhment, we muſt
needs acknowledge the Truth of
the Text, that Wicked Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eſcape without it.</p>
            <p>For to ſay nothing of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Lives of thoſe that were the
Leaders in the late Rebellion,
which were ſufficient to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
their pretences to any kind
of Religion; their open Violation
of all Honeſty and Godlineſs,
Plundering and Killing Men, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
Wives and Virgins, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57039:15"/>
Churches, and prophaning
Altars, are ſufficient to ſhew their
Character, and to cry up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for Vengeance, and make
Gods Juſtice glorious now it is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon them.</p>
            <p>And now let us lay hold of the
Occaſion, by reflecting on Gods
judgments upon others, to implore
the continuance of his Mercy to our
ſelves in this General Bleſſing; that
God would grant the King a Long
and Happy Reign, and ſave Him
from the hands of all His enemies,
whom whether it ſhall pleaſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God to clothe with ſhame
of their Proceedings for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and Repentance; or by
permitting them to go on in their
own Obſtinate and Deſtructive
Ways, to bring to their Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57039:15"/>
Puniſhment; yet may his
Throne be Eſtabliſhed in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and on His Head may
His Crown flouriſh. <hi>Amen.</hi>
